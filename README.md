# AI Task Creator - Precise Rubrics

A sophisticated web interface for creating AI evaluation tasks using the Precise Rubrics methodology. Designed with a modern, professional aesthetic inspired by [Mindrift.ai](https://mindrift.ai/).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This application helps AI researchers and evaluators create challenging tasks that test AI models' reasoning capabilities and instruction-following abilities. The interface guides users through a systematic 4-step process to develop tasks that achieve the target failure rate of >70% (success rate <30%).

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 Modern Dark Theme Design
- **Mindrift.ai inspired aesthetics** with purple-cyan gradients
- **Animated background** with subtle gradient shifting
- **Professional typography** using Inter font family
- **Smooth animations** and transitions throughout
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

### 🚀 4-Step Wizard Interface
1. **Create Prompt** - Rich text editor with formatting tools
2. **Test Model** - Generate and evaluate 4 model responses
3. **Create Rubric** - Define objective, binary evaluation criteria
4. **Evaluate Answers** - Score responses and validate target metrics

### 🤖 Advanced AI Task Creation
- **Prompt Generator** with 5 task templates (planning, analysis, creative, calculation, comparison)
- **Constraint System** for adding structure, format, length, and quantity requirements
- **Rich Text Editor** with formatting toolbar and paste handling
- **Real-time Validation** ensuring task quality and difficulty

### 📊 Comprehensive Evaluation System
- **Binary Scoring** with objective yes/no criteria
- **Real-time Percentage Calculation** for each response
- **Target Validation** ensuring <30% success rate
- **Interactive Tabs** for evaluating multiple responses
- **Visual Progress Tracking** throughout the process

### 💾 Smart Draft Management
- **Auto-save** functionality with localStorage
- **Draft Recovery** on page reload
- **Complete State Preservation** across all steps
- **Export/Submit** capabilities for task completion

## 🛠️ Technical Specifications

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5** with semantic structure
- **CSS3** with CSS Variables and modern features
- **Vanilla JavaScript** with ES6+ features
- **Font Awesome** icons for visual elements
- **Inter** font family for typography

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Dark theme with purple (#7C3AED) and cyan (#06B6D4) accents
- **Typography**: Inter font with multiple weights
- **Spacing**: Consistent rem-based spacing system
- **Animations**: 0.3s duration with ease transitions
- **Shadows**: Layered box-shadows for depth

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers supporting ES6+
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- localStorage API for draft management

## 🎨 Interface Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create Prompt
- Enter task title and select domain category
- Use rich text editor with formatting controls
- Add constraints to increase task difficulty
- Generate prompts from templates or create custom ones

### Step 2: Test Model
- Generate 4 simulated model responses
- Review each response for quality and compliance
- Mark responses that fail to meet requirements
- Regenerate responses if needed

### Step 3: Create Rubric
- Auto-generate basic criteria or create custom ones
- Define binary requirements for each criterion
- Manage multiple criteria with weighted scoring
- Preview rubric summary statistics

### Step 4: Evaluate Answers
- Switch between response tabs for evaluation
- Apply rubric criteria to each response
- View real-time score calculations
- Validate that target failure rate is achieved

## 📈 Best Practices for Task Creation

### Effective Challenge Types
- **Multi-step reasoning** requiring logical progression
- **Constraint adherence** with specific format requirements
- **Context integration** combining multiple information sources
- **Error detection** in provided data or scenarios

### What Makes AI Models Struggle
- **Precise counting** of specific elements
- **Complex formatting** requirements
- **Multi-layered constraints** that must all be satisfied
- **Context-dependent** reasoning across long prompts

### Evaluation Criteria Guidelines
- Use **binary (yes/no)** requirements only
- Make criteria **objectively measurable**
- Focus on **specific, observable** behaviors
- Avoid **subjective quality** judgments

## 🔧 Setup and Usage

1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Open `index.html`** in a modern web browser
3. **Start creating** your first AI evaluation task
4. **Follow the 4-step wizard** for guided task development
5. **Save drafts** automatically as you work
6. **Submit completed tasks** when validation passes

## 🎪 Demo Scenarios

### Planning Task Example
Create a detailed event plan with specific constraints on budget, timing, and participant roles. Tests the model's ability to balance multiple requirements while maintaining logical consistency.

### Analysis Task Example
Analyze sales data with specific calculation requirements and formatting constraints. Challenges the model's numerical reasoning and presentation skills.

### Creative Task Example
Write a story with exact character counts, specific literary devices, and formatting requirements. Tests creative ability while following precise instructions.
